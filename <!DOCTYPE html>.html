            Post-Identity Design: Brands, Politics, and Technological Instability

        <p>The authors argue that visual design, primarily branding, has taken on a more aspirational rather than representative role in the twentieth century. 

            A variety of forces are credited for this paradigm shift. Apart from the expected political and economic pressures, limitations of mass market consumer technology, and an evolving view of what constitutes elevated brand equity over the years have been some of the rather unsuspected contributors to the field of ‘corporate design’. 
            
            Alphabet Inc.’s passion for reductive design is not rooted in an obsession with minimalism, argue Villoroa and Hamamoto. The simplification of the Google search page logo (for that particular placement) has gone through multiple rounds of revisions with an increasingly singular goal: standardization of brand assets across thousands of internet devices with unique screen specifications, connected to varying internet speeds, dependent on processors of an even wider range of capabilities. Under such circumstances visual aesthetics have continuously lost detail, their touch with art, expression and the ability to offer visual delight in unexpected ways. Such pressures have paved the way for design to build elevated brand value, choosing uniformity over novelty.

        <p>As a result of these developments, the authors argue that humans have become economized, and the economy dehumanized. Tech increasingly gives personalities, forms, emotions, and other variants of design-led anthropomorphism to chipsets, softwares and data servers even at industry giants like Google Inc., which are painted in brand colors. 

            Aspirational story-telling through branding is not limited to the digital world. Nation branding projects where visual identity sets the tone, affords reputational value, and builds social capital for entire countries, are some of the other applications of branding in our time that are concerned with creating imagined identities, expressed visually.
            
            Hilary Clinton's 2008 Presidential campaign was supported by a similar strategy of brand-led, visual first communication and persuasion through the dynamic ‘H’ logo that was chosen for its simplicity and recognizability.  </p>
            
            <p>Open-source branding is another peculiar phenomenon of our times that is often seen in protests and civil rights movements in online spaces. Yellow and blue for Ukraine, Red for palestine, the yellow shirt movement in Thailand, and the Orange shirt anti-gun violence movement in the US are examples of where branding takes on a simple, but symbolic and meaningful role. 

                Design must concern itself with utility, value addition and adding meaning to user experiences, instead of engaging in deception or propaganda that are extreme outcomes of speculative design. </p>
